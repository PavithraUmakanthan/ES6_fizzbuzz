#main function that prints the return value from the fizzbuzz function
#work: 
#   Step1:the loop will run 100 times, once for each number between 1 and 100
#   Step2:it will pass that number as argument to the fizzbuzz function
#output (print): print the return value from the fizzbuzz function.

#fizzbuzz function that returns each number from 1 to 100 by replacing the number with fizz or buzz or fizzbuzz
#input (parameters) = 1 number from 1 to 100
#work:
#	Step1: check whether the number is divisible by both 3&5.
#	Step2: check whether the number is divisible only by 3.
#	Step3: check whether the number is divisible only by 5.
#output (return) = fizz or buzz or fizzbuzz or number itself
